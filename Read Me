Hello dear reader!,

(Sorry for my bad English I am Dutch..
I am JiveJungle a kid from the Nederlands that programs scripts and other stuff for fun!

I grew up with an amzing dad and mom. My dad was always busy with his computer and replaced once in a while his computer so that means I could have his parts of his computer that he didn't use anymore.. Years past by and I was 6 years old when I got all the parts for an entire computer!
I watched some YouTube videos and when I was almost seven I build my own computer out of diffrent computer parts!!
Since then I am starting programming and now I am here..

Thanks for reading!
And enjoy my creations ;)
